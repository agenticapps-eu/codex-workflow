## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Phase 0 — Repo bootstrap and Codex CLI research
  - README skeleton, MIT LICENSE, .gitignore, AGENTS.md placeholder
  - Trivial CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that prints the phase
    name; replaced with real CI in Phase 7
  - Three ADRs documenting the five Phase 0 research findings:
    - `docs/decisions/0001-codex-skill-naming.md` — skill directory paths,
      naming convention, packaging choice (loose skills + `install.sh` for
      v0.1.0; plugin manifest deferred to v0.2.0)
    - `docs/decisions/0002-stage2-independent-reviewer-on-codex.md` — Stage 2
      reviewer is implemented via `codex exec` child process with optional
      `--model` override; cross-host review via Claude Code MCP deferred
    - `docs/decisions/0003-gsd-entry-points-as-prompts.md` — Codex has no
      native `prompts/` surface; GSD entry points ship as skills with
      `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` and `default_prompt` in
      `agents/openai.yaml`
  - `research-complete` tag marks the end of Phase 0

- Phase 1 — Trigger skill
  - `skills/agentic-apps-workflow/SKILL.md` authored against
    `agenticapps-workflow-core` v0.1.0
  - Frontmatter cites `implements_spec: 0.1.0` per spec/09 conformance
  - Four canonical-prose blocks reproduced verbatim and byte-match
    confirmed against `agenticapps-workflow-core/spec/`:
    - Step 0 — Commitment Ritual (spec/01)
    - Rationalization Table (spec/03)
    - 13 Red Flags (spec/04)
    - Pressure-Test Scenarios (spec/05)
  - Step 1 (4-row task-size table), Step 2 (GSD entry-point routing),
    Step 3 (15-gate binding table mapping every spec/02 gate to a
    `codex-*` skill), Step 4 (ADR capture pointers), Verification
    Check (5 host-specific bash snippets covering commitment block,
    TDD commit pairs, Stage 2 evidence, per-`must_have` evidence,
    and `implements_spec` currency)

### Pending

- Phase 2 — 13 gate-fulfilling skills (`codex-brainstorming`,
  `codex-tdd`, `codex-verification`, `codex-spec-review`,
  `codex-code-review`, `codex-design-shotgun`, `codex-design-critique`,
  `codex-cso`, `codex-qa`, `codex-impeccable-audit`,
  `codex-database-sentinel-audit`, `codex-systematic-debugging`,
  `codex-finishing-branch`)
- Phase 3 — 5 GSD entry-point skills (per ADR-0003: skills, not prompts)
- Phases 4–7 — setup/update lifecycle, migration framework, install.sh,
  self-applied workflow, v0.1.0 release
